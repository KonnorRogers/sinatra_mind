# Usage

<p> This is merely a repo, there is a command w/ in app/lib/game.rb should you clone this repo </p>
<p> That can be run for a CLI version. However, this is intended for running on a sinatra / heroku server. </p>

# Issues

<p> No issues noted at this time. Possibly CSS issues related to browser support </p>

# Future Development

<p> Adding in Rake tasks that actually do stuff </p>
<p> Adding in Procfile for heroku rather than letting heroku default it </p>
